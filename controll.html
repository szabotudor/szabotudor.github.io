                <a href="https://noorwool.itch.io/out-of-controll">Out Of Controll</a> is a versus arcade racing game, where you use any tools at your disposal to win a race<br><br>
                Shoot carrot bombs, lay melon mines, throw eggs at others' windshields, and try to not fall off the track.

                This was my first big Unreal project, so I worked mostly in Blueprints.<br><br>
                I was responsible for the car physics and tooling for importing car models into Unreal.<br><br>
                Most of the pre-made configurable cars in Unreal have realistic physics, that don't align with our more wacky, kart-racer type vision that we had for the game.<br>
                This meant that I had to implement the physics myself.
