                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3365840/">The Final Print</a> is a story-focused adventure game made in Unreal Engine 5 about a journalist solving a murder in Harlem, New York, in the 1940s.<br><br>
                The game was made by me and my team as our Year 3 project at BUAS<br><br>
                I was Lead Programmer, and my main roles in the development process were <b>Project Vision</b> and <b>Engine Tools</b>.

                The first tool I made was the BlueprintAccessor.<br><br>
                It is meant to simplify interacting with Blueprints from C++.<br><br>
                It was useful because our game had a lot of Blueprints that needed to be triggered from the more performance critical C++ code.

                In a game with a long story and dialogue options, it's useful to have tools to speed up testing.<br><br>
                The Debug Menu does that through features like skipping through dialogue or giving items to the player.<br><br>
                It is implemented using ImGui, and exposes all functions and variables from any actor that the "DebugMenu" component is added on, as long as their type is registered.<br><br>

                I also worked on parts of automated tooling, like our CI/CD pipeline, using Jenkins.<br><br>
