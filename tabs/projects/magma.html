        <a href="https://github.com/szabotudor/magma" target="_blank">Magma Engine</a> is a custom game engine written in C/C++. It uses ImGui for the editor interface, which makes it extendable with custom plugins and add-ons. Powering the engine is the SystemManager, designed to allow adding or modifying systems within the engine.

    <div class="project-text">
        The SystemManager makes creating new systems a simple task. You can create a class inheriting from the System base and add it to the engine.

    <div class="project-text">
        Multi-platform support ensures that Magma works on both Windows and Linux. Porting it to other platforms is easy thanks to its modularity.

    <div class="project-text">
        The engine’s backend is abstracted and easily replaceable. For example, changing the graphics/compute backend is as simple as swapping out the backend library.
