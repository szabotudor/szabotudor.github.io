    <div class="fancy-box" alt="about">
        <div class="project-text">
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3365840/">The Final Print</a> is a story-focused adventure game made in Unreal Engine 5 about a journalist solving a murder in Harlem, New York, in the 1940s.<br><br>
            The game was made by me and my team as our Year 3 project at BUAS<br><br>
            I was Lead Programmer, and my main roles in the development process were <b>Project Vision</b> and <b>Engine Tools</b>.

    <div class="fancy-box" id="Blueprint Accessor">
        <div class="project-text">
            The first tool I made was the BlueprintAccessor.<br><br>
            It is meant to simplify interacting with Blueprints from C++.<br><br>
            It was useful because our game had a lot of Blueprints that needed to be triggered from the more performance critical C++ code.

    <div class="fancy-box" id="Debug Menu">
        <div class="project-text">
            In a game with a long story and dialogue options, it's useful to have tools to speed up testing.<br><br>
            The Debug Menu does that through features like skipping through dialogue or giving items to the player.<br><br>
            It is implemented using ImGui, and exposes all functions and variables from any actor that the "DebugMenu" component is added on, as long as their type is registered.<br><br>

            I also worked on parts of automated tooling, like our CI/CD pipeline, using Jenkins.<br><br>
            I was responsible for Steam build uploads and Automated Tests using Unreal's Automation system.<br><br>
