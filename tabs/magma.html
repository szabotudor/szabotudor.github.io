            <a href="https://github.com/szabotudor/magma">Magma Engine</a> is a custom game engine written in C/C++.<br><br>
            It uses ImGui to display the editor interface, making it easy to extend with custom plugins and add-ons.<br><br>
            Powering the engine is the SystemManager, designed to allow adding to, or modifying the engine's systems.

            The SystemManager makes creating new systems a simple task.<br><br>
            Make a class inheriting from System as a base.<br>Then add it to the engine by creating the system.<br><br>
            This design ensures extendability and compartmentalization of systems.<br><br>
            The API is minimal and simple to use, almost no boilerplate needed.

            Or even better, replace existing systems at any time outside of that system's update functions.<br><br>

        <div class="text">
            Magma also has an API for creating editor windows.<br><br>
            Just like systems, different types of windows can be added to the editor (when available).<br><br>
            The base Magma code uses both the SystemManager and the EditorWindow for its built-in systems, so everything is modular.

        <div class="text">
            The engine is multi-platform.<br>It works on Windows and Linux, and it can build games for both platforms.<br><br>
            Porting the engine to other platforms is easy thanks to its modularity.<br><br>
            Everything a user might interact with is abstracted: the filesystem, the graphics and compute API etc.

            Everything is modifiable and replaceable.<br><br>
            The graphics/compute backend is a simple wrapper for any graphics API (in this case, OpenGL).<br>
            Changing it is a drop-in replacement, just place a different backend library inside the "shared" folder, and the engine will pick it up.<br><br>
            The backend is a simple interface, following <a href="https://github.com/szabotudor/magma/blob/main/backends/include/backend.hpp">this standard</a>.
